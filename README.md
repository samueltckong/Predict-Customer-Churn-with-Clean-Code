## Project Description

Customer churn is a critical problem for businesses in various industries. This project analyzes customer data and builds predictive models to identify potential churners. The workflow includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Importing and preparing the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and relationships in the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming data to optimize model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Using logistic regression and random forest classifiers to predict churn.
- **DevOps Practices**: Incorporating logging and testing to ensure maintainable and reproducible code.

## Files and Data Description
The repository contains the following key files:

- churn_library.py: Core library for data processing, EDA, feature engineering, and model training.
- churn_script_logging_and_tests.py: Script to test the functions in churn_library.py and log the results.
- requirements.txt: File specifying required libraries.
- README.md: Project documentation.
- Data Folder: Contains the input dataset (bank_data.csv).
- Logs Folder: Stores log files generated during testing (churn_library.log).
- Images Folder: Stores output images generated by EDA and model evaluation.
- Models Folder: Stores trained models in pickle format.

## Testing and Logging
Testing and logging are integral to the project to ensure that functions in churn_library.py work as expected. Follow the steps below to test the code and generate logs:

- Run the churn_script_logging_and_tests.py script from the command line:
ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py

- This command will execute all test functions in the script. The results, including any errors or successes, will be logged to the churn_library.log file in the /logs folder.

- Open the churn_library.log file to review the log messages:
cat logs/churn_library.log

The log file will include details about:
- Successful execution of test cases.
- Any errors encountered during testing.
- Verification of file outputs, such as EDA images and model files.

## Expected Outputs
After running the testing script, you should observe the following outputs:

- Log File:
Located at logs/churn_library.log.
Contains information about the test results for each function.

- EDA Images:
Located in the /images folder.
Includes visualizations such as distributions, box plots, and count plots.

- Model Files:
Located in the /models folder.
Includes trained models (logistic_model.pkl and rfc_model.pkl).

- Evaluation Reports:
Located in the /images folder.
Includes classification reports, ROC curves, and feature importance plots.
